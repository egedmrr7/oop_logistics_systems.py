- Object-Oriented design

## Stage 2 – Basic Implementation
- Package registration
- Package tracking by ID
- Sorting packages by priority, weight, destination
- Distance calculation between hubs

## Stage 3 – Advanced Application
- Multi-hub routing
- Shortest path calculation (Greedy / Dijkstra logic)
- Delivery grouping optimization
- SQLite database integration
- Web interface using Flask
- Performance reports (average delivery time, success ratio)

## Technologies
- Python
- Flask
- SQLite
- HTML / CSS
- Javascript

## How to Run
