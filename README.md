# Logistics System - Stage 1

This project is a simple **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** implementation written for a university assignment.  
The goal of **Stage 1** is to build the basic structure of the logistics system using Python classes.

## 🎯 Stage 1 Requirements Completed

- A `Package` class with attributes such as ID, sender, receiver, weight, and destination.
- A `DeliveryPerson` class representing employees who deliver packages.
- A `LogisticsSystem` class that stores packages and delivery people.
- Ability to add new packages.
- Ability to add delivery personnel.
- Ability to assign packages to delivery people.
- Ability to track the delivery status of a package.
- All classes are written using OOP principles.

## 📁 Files

- `logistics_system.py` — Main Python file containing Stage 1 implementation.
- `uml.md` — UML class diagram (Mermaid format).
- `README.md` — This file.

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
python3 logistics_system.py
```

## 👨‍💻 Student Note

This project represents the first step of building a larger logistics software.  
In Stage 1, my main focus was understanding class structures and the relationships between objects.  
Next stages will include routing, time estimation, and UI improvements.
